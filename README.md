# 🌲 Optimal Binary Search Tree Visualizer
This is a simple and interactive web application that helps you build and visualize an Optimal Binary Search Tree (OBST) from a given set of keys and their corresponding search frequencies. It also allows you to search a key and see its level and the path taken.

Built using Flask for backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript + D3.js for visualization.

---
## 🚀 Features
✅ Input your own keys and frequencies.

✅ Generate the Optimal BST with minimum search cost.

✅ View total optimal cost.

✅ Search for a key in the tree and visualize the traversal path and level.

✅ Clean and intuitive user interface.

## 🧠 What is an Optimal Binary Search Tree?
An Optimal Binary Search Tree is a BST that minimizes the expected search cost, assuming known access frequencies for each key. It is useful in scenarios like compiler symbol tables, dictionaries, and other static search applications.
